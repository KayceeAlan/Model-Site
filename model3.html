                <h3>Shudu, the digital supermodel who is changing the face of fashion one campaign at a time</h3>
                <p>Shudu is my muse – as a photographer, if I get inspired and want to try out a new lighting concept, I can do that at any time of the day,” says Cameron-James Wilson, the creator of the CGI avatar – or digital supermodel as he calls her.</p>
                <p>Working with the Vogue Australia team on these images, the process involved photographing real Tiffany & Co. jewellery pieces from its new Paper Flowers collection on a stand-in model before blending the photographs with three-dimensional renders to create the hyper-realistic portraits of Shudu. Each image can take days to produce.</p>
                <p>“Working with such delicate and intricate pieces was such an exciting challenge,” he says. “I had to adopt new techniques in order to blend Shudu’s virtual presence with th every real Tiffany pieces.”</p>
                <p>For Wilson, Shudu is a creative project, away to explore his interest in illustration, make-up, fashion and design as well as three dimensional imaging. “So, really, this encompasses and appeals to all my creative tendencies,” he explains of his endeavours.</p>
                <p>With questions raised around authenticity and identity on the internet, the increased prevalence of these avatars – the terminology that Wilson is most familiar with, given his background in gaming – is both a result of a digital realm and reality merging, and a comment on humans’ relationship with technology. “I love to wonder about fakery and what exactly it means,” says Wilson. “Where do we draw the line between fantasy and reality? What is real, anyway? Pushing the fantasy into reality, Shudu has more skin texture than your average Instagram post,” he quips.</p>
