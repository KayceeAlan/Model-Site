                <h3>Hoyeon Jung’s Skin Care and Makeup Secrets</h3>
                <p>“Actually, it was an accident!” Jung says, shaking a hand through her strands. Back in Seoul, where she first made a name for herself and where the city’s Fashion Week is currently in full swing, the 22-year-old sported a more muted shade of reddish-brown for the textured waves that she tossed playfully about on the runway and as a next-level street style star. But when Jung popped into her Seoul salon for a touch-up a few days before moving to New York City to begin her global career, “I told my colorist, ‘I think a little redder than usual,’ since there were still three weeks before Fashion Week,” she recalls, explaining that red pigment tends to fade quickly. “It turned out super red. But really, it suits me so well!”</p>
                <p>The game-changing power of an unconventional color can be fearsome. For Jung, it won her easy friends (“They’d come up first and say, ‘ah, I love your hair color!’ ”) and caught countless eyes at castings in New York, Milan, and Paris. “That reaction has made me feel so much more confident,” she says. “I feel like I have a new image now—I can wear all black without being boring—and that’s a great feeling.”</p>
                <p>Since the move, Jung entrusts her flame-hued lengths to Victoria Hunter at Whittemore House Salon in the West Village, the cult colorist responsible for the bleach blonde transformations at Alexander Wang this season, and maintains its sheen with cold water rinses, cool blow-dries, and gobs of hair oil, brushed lightly on the ends to keep the curl. Judging by the video, above, where she reveals her skin and makeup secrets, Jung is a bit of a beauty guru in the making—crafting a just-bitten two-toned lip and demonstrating a de-puffing pressure point massage. “As a model, my body is important, so I learned all the points,” she says, pressing a wooden tool into the crook of her thumb. “Taking care of yourself inside and outside is what’s key.” Luckily, Jung has that covered, from the inside out.</p>
