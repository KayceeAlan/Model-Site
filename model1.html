                <h3>Using Fashion as a Platform to Advocate for Indigenous Rights</h3>
                <p>"A lot of people have been taught for hundreds of years to kind of hate themselves for being Indigenous," he says on the phone. "I feel like it's important that people reclaim who they are."</p>
                <p>For Haatepah, the issue is both systemic and personal. Adopted alongside his twin brother at age five by two non-Native dads into a largely non-Native community, Haatepah remembers being bullied as a kid for looking different than his peers.</p>
                <p>"It was hard growing up in a place that wasn't very diverse," he says.</p>
                <p>But the issue went beyond the school cafeteria. Though one of his fathers was supportive of Haatepah and his brother seeking out more knowledge and connection to their Native roots, the other wasn't — and when the more supportive parent died while the twins where just 17, their other dad began to make life at home increasingly difficult for them.</p>
                <p>"He would say racist things at the dinner table, like 'don't become a drunken Indian,'" Haatepah explains. "Me and my brother didn't stick up for ourselves until we reached a boiling point. And then we told him, 'We're not going to take this kind of verbal abuse anymore,' and we left for Los Angeles. We didn't have much of a plan but to stay with our friend. We were homeless for a good bit."</p>
                <p>As painful as some parts of his personal history have been, Haatepah takes pride in the resilience that's helped him survive tough circumstances — and sees that resilience as part of his heritage. As an adult, he's has gotten involved with a host of organizations aimed at championing Native voices, from the Native American Club at his college to the Student Council of Indian Tribal Nations, the International Indigenous Youth Council and the American Indian Movement. Haatepah and his brother also started an organization of their own, called the Indigenous Alliance Movement.</p>
